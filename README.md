### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the my first time doing ==mobile-first workflow== approach. To be honest I struggled a lot, especially in responsiveness of the design e.g. relative units. It's fun taking a different approach though.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue doing a mobile-first workflow approach, and study some of the fundamentals concept, like relative and absolute units, before diving too deep in css layout such as Flexbox and Grid.

### Useful resources
